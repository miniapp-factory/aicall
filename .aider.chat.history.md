Create a mobile app for poetry lovers where users can read, write, and share poems in a creative and interactive way. The app allows users to explore a vast library of poems from different authors, styles, and languages, search by themes, emotions, or keywords, and receive AI-generated suggestions for rhymes, metaphors, or poetic ideas. Users can write their own poems using flexible editors, apply stylistic templates, and get instant feedback or inspiration from AI or the community. The app can include challenges, prompts, or collaborative writing features where multiple users create poems together, as well as mood-based recommendations that match the user’s current feelings. The interface should feel artistic, calming, and inspiring, with beautiful typography, soothing colors, and subtle animations. Optional features could include audio recordings, spoken-word performances, or sharing poems on social media. The unique appeal of the app is combining personal creativity, AI guidance, and social interaction to make poetry writing, discovery, and appreciation engaging and enjoyable for everyone.

Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can update the title and description. Once that file is available, I’ll also create the logo generation file `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`.
